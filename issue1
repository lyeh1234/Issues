Issue 1: Pre-existing User Page Freezes for a Certain Sequence

When the user wants to create a new account and they enter a pre-existing user's username as their new account username, it shows the pre-existing username flash alert. 
However, once the user types all of the credentials to create a new account the second time, this time passing all requirements, the Create Account page gets stuck in loading.

Steps to Recreate Issue:
1) type pre-existing username in ("yehl" is a pre-existing username)
2) enter the password and email with passing requirements
3) submit and it will show the pre-existing user flash alert
4) now enter a unique username, password, and email with passing requirements
