Issue 2: New User Page's Recipe Book leads to server error

Once a new account is created the Create Account page leads the user to the webapp, in which they can add ingredients, recipes, etc.
However, the button that shows the recipe book has a server error. The new user has no recipe book, it should at least show a blank recipe book.

Steps to Recreate Issue:
1) Create a new account with passing requirements for username, password, and email
2) Click submit to create the account, leading the user to the page to add ingredients/recipes.
3) Click on the "My Recipe Book" to get to the server error.
