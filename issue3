Issue 3: Email requirements passes without adding a period "."

When the user enters credentials to create a new account, they can create a new account even though the email address is missing a period "."
In the passing requirements fine print, it says the email address should have an "@" and a "." to successfully register.

Steps to Recreate Issue:
1) Go to Create Account
2) Enter passing credentials for username, password
3) For email, enter an email without a period (i.e. yehl@oregonstateedu)
4) Click Submit and it should show a green flash alert saying the account was created
